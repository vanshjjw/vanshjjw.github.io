The [SNEWS](https://snews.org) collaboration is a global network of neutrino detectors designed to provide early warning of galactic supernovas.
One of the key steps in their analysis is to find the time-difference between neutrino arrivals at detectors around the world. 

I helped optimise this part of directional analysis algorithm by **reformulating the mathematics** and developing a **specialised calculation method** that 
reduced processing time from hours to **under 2 minutes** - fast enough to give astronomers time to observe the entire optical spectrum of a supernova event.

[QTicTacToe](https://qtictactoe.org) is an educational simulation that demonstrates quantum computing principles through a 
playable quantum version of the classic game. I contributed to developing the **quantum state representation** and created a
 **simplified visual interface** that helps users understand superposition and entanglement while playing. The application reduces complex quantum 
 concepts to **intuitive game mechanics** - making quantum physics accessible to students without advanced mathematical background.

ðŸ”¬ **Bivariate Bicycle Quantum Error-Correction Codes**

Working under **Prof. Dan Browne** at University College London during Summer 2024, I tackled fundamental challenges in quantum computing reliability.

**Research Achievements:**
- Constructed an innovative algorithm utilizing bivariate codes with disconnected Tanner graphs
- Developed a family of codes with constant check-weights and increasing encoding rates
- Explored the generalisation of bicycle codes to non-abelian (symmetric) groups
- Created a comprehensive codebase for numerical code search and property visualization

**Technical Implementation:**
- Designed efficient algorithms to optimize quantum code structure
- Built visualization tools to understand complex code properties
- Implemented systematic testing frameworks to validate performance
- Published reusable components on PyPI for broader research community access

*This research contributes to the growing field of quantum error correction, addressing one of the key obstacles in developing practical, fault-tolerant quantum computers.*
