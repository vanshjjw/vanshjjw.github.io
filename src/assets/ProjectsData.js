const snewsDescription =
`ðŸ”¬ **Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS)**

Designed and optimized algorithms for detecting and analyzing supernova signals as part of an international collaboration. My work focused on:

- Developing more efficient triangulation algorithms
- Implementing CUDA acceleration for faster analysis
- Creating visualization tools for directional data
- Benchmarking and optimizing key algorithms

This research contributes to astronomers' ability to quickly identify and respond to supernova events.`
