By day (and most nights), I’m a student of physics. That mostly means chasing elegant models, solving interesting problems, 
and occasionally staring at a whiteboard like it might answer back. Along the way, I’ve picked up snippets of computer science, 
philosophy, and startup wisdom. Sometimes, I build things that are cool and nerdy. More often, I care about understanding things at a 
fundamental level. I’m still figuring out the right balance between the two.

I haven’t always been great at finishing or sharing my projects and ideas. This website is an attempt at 
self-accountability—part resume, part notebook, part second brain. If you're here take a look around; maybe
you'll find something interesting.
