// Personal information

`
By day (and most nights), I am a student of physics. Along the way, I've collected snippets of computer science, 
philosophy, and startup wisdom. Sometimes I build things that are cool and nerdy. More commonly, I sit down and 
try to understand things deeply. 

In the past, I haven't been great at presenting my projects and ideas. This website is part of my ongoing attempt at 
self-accountability â€“ part resume, part second brain, and part simmering ideas. Look around, maybe you'll find something 
you like.
