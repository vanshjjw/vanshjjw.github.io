// Personal information

`
By day, and most nights, I study maths and physics. That mostly means chasing elegant models, solving interesting problems, 
and occasionally staring at a whiteboard like it might answer back. Along the way, I’ve picked up snippets of computer science, 
philosophy, and startup wisdom. Sometimes, I build things that are cool and nerdy. More often, I care about understanding things at a 
fundamental level.

I haven’t always been great at finishing or sharing my projects and ideas. This website is an attempt at 
self-accountability—part resume, part notebook, part second brain. If you're here take a look around; maybe
you'll like something.
